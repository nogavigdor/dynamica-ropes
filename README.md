# dynamica-ropes
 A fictional multimedia company website. A second semester project.
 
 This is a landing page which I built as part of group project.
 I have styled the header and the footer so it will resember the original website.
 All the header/footer links are directed to the index page since it is prototype.
 In this project I've used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
 
 The website link:
